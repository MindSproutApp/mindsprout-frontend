    <h2>User Generated Content</h2>
    <p>The Services may enable you to submit journal entries, chat logs, or mood quiz responses. These are stored privately in your account and are not publicly accessible. We do not control who you choose to share this information with outside of our Services, and we cannot ensure that parties who have access to such information will respect your privacy or keep it secure.

    <h2>Third Party Websites and Links</h2>
    <p>Our Site may provide links to websites or other online platforms operated by third parties. If you follow links to sites not affiliated or controlled by us, you should review their privacy and security policies and other terms and conditions. We do not guarantee and are not responsible for the privacy or security of such sites, including the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of information found on these sites.</p>
    
    <h2>Children’s Data</h2>
    <p>The Services are not intended to be used by children, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information about children. If you are the parent or guardian of a child who has provided us with their personal information, you may contact us using the contact details set out below to request that it be deleted.</p>
    <p>As of the Effective Date of this Privacy Policy, we do not have actual knowledge that we “share” or “sell” personal information of individuals under 16 years of age.</p>
    
    <h2>Security and Retention of Your Information</h2>
    <p>Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee “perfect security.” In addition, any information you send to us may not be secure while in transit. We recommend that you do not use unsecure channels to communicate sensitive or confidential information to us.</p>
    <p>How long we retain your personal information depends on different factors, such as whether we need the information to maintain your account, provide the Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce other applicable contracts and policies.
